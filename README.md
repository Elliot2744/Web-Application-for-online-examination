# Web-Application-for-online-examination

During this pandemic, we realized that everything is getting online. Studies, work, meetings, etc was from home. So we thought why not exams are taken online. 
It would be very beneficial if there would be a way that students can give an online examination. So we came up with this idea of online examination.

Here the project is divided into two modules : teacher module and student module.

teacher generates exam and set the question paper. 
student first have to enter a unique exam id provided by teacher. Then they will see the upcoming examinations and then on specific date and time they can appear for the examination.
